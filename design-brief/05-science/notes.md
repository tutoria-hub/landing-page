## Open Questions

- [ ] [Question for designer/developer]

Example:
- [ ] Should we link "literally rewires the brain" to a research paper?
- [ ] Should we add a citation tooltip on hover?
- [ ] Should we change "50-90%" to a more specific stat?

## Research Citations (Phase 2)

**To Link**:
1. "literally rewires the brain" → [Research paper URL]
2. "50-90% can reach grade-level" → [Harvard Medical Journal citation URL]
3. "years of high brain plasticity" → [Neuroscience research URL]

**Example Format**:
- Source: Harvard Medical School Study (2023)
- URL: https://example.com/research
- Key finding: [Summary]

## Copy Alternatives

**Current Paragraph 1**: "Young brains are remarkably adaptable. Research shows that structured phonics intervention literally rewires the brain—changes are seen within weeks, and 50-90% can reach grade-level when support arrives during the years of high brain plasticity."

**Alternative**: [Your variation]

**Current Paragraph 2**: "tutoria makes expert phonics intervention universally accessible, adapts to each learner's unique pace and needs, and makes it simple for any parent to help, regardless of their own reading background."

**Alternative**: [Your variation]

## Credibility Enhancements (Phase 2)

**Ideas to Consider**:
- [ ] Add animated counter for "50-90%" statistic
- [ ] Add logos of research institutions (Harvard, NIH, etc.)
- [ ] Add "Backed by research" badge
- [ ] Add inline citations with hover tooltips
- [ ] [Your idea]
